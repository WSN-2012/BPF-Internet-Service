# Internet Service for the BPF (Bundle Protocol Framework) 

## General
### About
This is a project made by (or partially by) WSN-Team 2012 in the course CSD, which is part of the [Technology Transfer Alliance](http://ttaportal.org/).
### Purpose
One of the goals of the project is to be able to send data upstream from rural areas and to do this DTN communication has been used.
### Description
This project is a service implementing the BPF and providing the functionalities for the server needed within the context of the WSN-Team 2012 project.  This service is based on a Linux environment and implements the platform-dependent classes of the BPF. In particular for the server node, the service collects all received bundles, decrypts them if necessary, parses the payload content according to the format that we expect from the WSN gateway, and finally stores the data in the database. Data stored in the database can be accessed by using another project developed as part of the WSN-Team 2012 project: [Website](https://github.com/WSN-2012/Website).
## Build & Install
### Prerequisites
You will need to have ant to compile this in an easy way. To get ant look into how to install it on your platform.

The project is also using a database in order to store bundle payload. The database folder is the same with the one in Website project available in WSN-2012 repository.
In this project we used postreSQL vesrion 9.1 to create our database schema. Any database can be used if appropriate changes are commited in the Database.java and SQLQueries.java files.
To download and install postgreSQL you can go to [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) and download the appropriate source. Then follow the [installation instructions](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/interactive/index.html). To load the database schema you have to do the following from command line:
1.	`psql postgres`(connect to database as postgres user)
2.	`CREATE DATABASE "DatabaseName";` (create database)
3.	`psql databasename < data_base_dump` (import DB from dump file *outside the psql command line*. The projects database dump file is stored in the database folder. **Notice:** database should be created before importing the dump file) 
4.	Insert your database specifications in the [src/database/SQLQueries.java](https://github.com/WSN-2012/Website/blob/master/src/database/SQLQueries.java) file where todo comments appear.

### Building
The BPF is included as a submodule and it is built automatically when building the service. It is possible to configure several settings in the configuration file.
Follow the below steps to build service and BPF.

1.  `git clone --recursive https://github.com/WSN-2012/BPF-Base-Service.git`
2.  `cd BPF-Base-Service`
3.  `vi config/dtn.config.xml`
4.  `ant`

Note: When building the configuration located in config/dtn.config.xml is copied into the build folder together with the built jar. If you want to change any configuration options please edit the configuration stored in the built folder or rebuild.

### Start/Stop script
To just run the application after building it:

1.  `./run.sh`

To install a start/stop script, follow the below steps:

1.  `cp linux-scripts/bpf-service /etc/init.d/bpf-service`
2.  `/etc/init.d/bpf-service start`
3.  `/etc/init.d/bpf-service stop`

### Monitoring
To be able to monitor the service and automatically restarting it, we suggest using monit. To do this you will need to have set up the start/stop scripts as shown above. Follow the below steps to set the monitoring up:

1.  Install monit on your system. E.g: `sudo apt-get install monit`
2.  `cp linux-scripts/bpf-service.monit /etc/monit/conf.d/bpf-service`
3.  `/etc/init.d/monit restart`

### Start at boot
Do not forget to add the service to start at boot. E.g: `sudo updateâ€“rc.d bpf-service defaults`
